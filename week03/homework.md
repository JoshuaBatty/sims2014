## Homework

Non-code:

Take a video of “real world particles”
see for example, http://vimeo.com/28732551

Code:

(a) Create a looping fireworks animation (non interactive). You will need to reset or restart particles every so often. (and then we’ll figure out how to save this as a screen saver for your mom!)

(b) Since you know how to position things in a circle using the formula: 

	x = x_orig + radius * cos (angle); 
	y = y_orig + radius * sin (angle); 

Think about how you could use sinusoidal information to start all the particles with some interesting positions / velocities. Instead of using random, use sinusoidal information (in any way you want) to make the starting positions/velocities of these objects interesting. can you use sin/cos to make the movement or drawing of the particle more interesting?

(c) Besides evidence to the contrary, particles don’t have to be just circles! you can draw them however you want. Can you create an interesting effect with transparency or by using images? Can you use parameters, like velocity to control the way these objects are drawn (like, they get smaller as they slow down, or more transparent, using angle of the velocity to rotate, etc). Think about trying to create a natural phenomenon, one of your videos or simply something really nice looking to simulate the behavior/structure/growing or composition with particles
