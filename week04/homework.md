## Homework

## Non-Code:
[Dan Savage introduced the 12 basic principles of animation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation). Scour youtube, and find examples for **SIX** of the twelve.  You should have a text file in your repo with links to the videos and which principle they embody.  We'll look at some in class, so be sure to get it in on time!

## Code:

1. Take the examples ```00_Seek``` and ```01_SeekAvoid``` and convert the last one to handle an arbitrary number of cars.

2. Read [Chapter 6.8 and 6.9](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/) of Daniel Shiffman on-line book and make an openFrameworks implementation of Daniel’s path following algorithms

3. After researching [Dan Savage’s 12 principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation), make a **looping** composition that specifically embodies a minimum of two of these.  Think of this animation as something you'd want to export and put up on your own vimeo page.

4. Squash and stretch really help things come alive.  Build squash and stretch into one of our particle simulations.  When a particle collides, it should squash, and when it's flying at high speed, it should stretch!  Pay attention to which direction it squashes and stretches.  You may want to make particles bigger so it's easier to see.

5. Implement the 4th unofficial rule of flocking we discussed in class. A boid is only considered if it's with another boid's field of vision. 

Advanced:

6. Try to make a "strange attractor" in openFrameworks.  It's a fractal structure and you can think of it similarly to the lissajous curves we were making before.  This one is probably a test of your research skills more than anything else!  Here's an example of one written in actionscript http://www.joa-ebert.com/swf/index.php?swf=alchemy/Example03  This one is in 3D, but 2D is great too!
