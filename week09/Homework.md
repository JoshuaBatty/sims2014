## Non-code:

Bring sketches and materials (drawings, videos, photos, models, sculptures, etcâ€¦) of what you want to do for your final project

## Code:
1. Choose a shader from [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) write on WebGL and convert it to openGL 2.0 (that we use on OF)

2. Research, port and use a Perlin noise function in a GLSL Shader

3. Use a shader to simulate a natural phenomena
