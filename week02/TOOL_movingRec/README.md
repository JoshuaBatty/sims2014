# Trace Recorder

For those who don't have afterEffect experience like me I made this app that lets you trace videos. 

To make a stop-motion you can record your own video using this app by pressing 'r', or you can convert another video file by simply dropping it over app.

Once you have your video mounted you can stop/play by pressing the SPACEBAR. For moving along the frames use your LEFT and RIGHT keys. 

You can position the dot by dragging it.

Save everything on your data folder.

You can load it later by using the UP and DOWN keys.
