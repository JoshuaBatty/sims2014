## Homework

Non-code:

a) Using a stationary video camera, make three recordings of three different scenes which have interesting motion. Pick one point to watch during the video, and sketch out itâ€™s motion path. Try to find both rhythmic (repetitive) and organic motions.

Code:

a) Take your xeno code from your homework last week and convert it to run with vectors instead of points.

b) Create a square canvas, and play with leaving trails for objects in motion by not clearing the screen.  Play with shapes and colors and see what the most interesting composition you can make is.  Take screenshots of the top 3 you come up with.

c) A constant acceleration we have pulling on us as humans is gravity!  Make an application that launches a ball at a random velocity on every click, and then pull it back to earth with gravity.  Gravity here is 9.8 meters per second, try making a variation with the moon's gravity, and another with Jupiters gravity.

d) Use sin / cos to emulate a natural phenomenon.  Post a picture or video of what your phenomenon is along with you application.

e) Use atan2 in conjunction with some mouse follow code (xeno) or the previous vector/acceleration work and create a creature that follows a point.  Think os using sin/cos to give it living characteristics based on it's motion.  (think of more subtle motions of creatures, breathing, blinking, leg motion, etc)
