# Description
My Midterm is based on my fascination with the fundamental building blocks of the universe. As a former astrophysicist, my creative interests lie somewhere in the intersection of art and science. I will continue to push this concept of "simulating" the geometries that govern our entire universe.


Here is a short compilation of the 6 pieces that I made for the midterm: [Midterm Compilation Video](https://vimeo.com/108428005)

Here is the work of [Reza Syed](http://www.syedrezaali.com/#/a-drifting-up/) who I based a few of these early sketches off of. Reza is an amazing code artist!!! I have long admired his work and can only hope to one day be as talented a coding artist as he is!
